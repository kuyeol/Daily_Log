/**
 * Tarjan's algorithm is a linear time algorithm to find the strongly connected components of a
   directed graph, which, from here onwards will be referred as SCC.

 * A graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.
   The SCCs of a directed graph form a partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly
 connected. Single node is always a SCC.

 * Example:
    0 --------> 1 -------> 3 --------> 4
    ^          /
    |         /
    |        /
    |       /
    |      /
    |     /
    |    /
    |   /
    |  /
    | /
    |V
    2

    For the above graph, the SCC list goes as follows:
    1, 2, 0
    3
    4

    We can also see that order of the nodes in an SCC doesn't matter since they are in cycle.

 {@summary}
    Tarjan's Algorithm:
    * DFS search produces a DFS tree
    * Strongly Connected Components form subtrees of the DFS tree.
    * If we can find the head of these subtrees, we can get all the nodes in that subtree (including
 the head) and that will be one SCC.
    * There is no back edge from one SCC to another (here can be cross edges, but they will not be
 used).

    * Kosaraju Algorithm aims at doing the same but uses two DFS traversalse whereas Tarjanâ€™s
 algorithm does the same in a single DFS, which leads to much lower constant factors in the latter.
