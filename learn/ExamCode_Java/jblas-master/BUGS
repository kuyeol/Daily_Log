Known Bugs:

- XERBLA handling under Mac OS X

  Under Mac OS X, xerbla isn't properly handled, leading to an error message
and the exit of the program. The linker does not take our own version
of xerbla, but instead uses the one supplied by the BLAS library. I
still need to figure out what the right options are.
