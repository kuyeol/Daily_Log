/**
 * Native BLAS and LAPACK functions.
 *
 * <p>The <%= classname %> class contains the native BLAS and LAPACK functions. Each
 * Fortran function is mapped to a static method of this class. For each array argument,
 * an additional parameter is introduced which gives the offset from the beginning of
 * the passed array. In C, you would be able to pass a different pointer, but
 * in Java, you can only pass the whole array.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that due to the way the JNI is usually implemented, the arrays are first
 * copied outside of the JVM before the function is called. This means that
 * functions whose runtime is linear in the amount of memory do usually not
 * run faster just because you are using a native implementation. This holds true
 * for most Level 1 BLAS routines (like vector addition), and unfortunately also
 * for most Level 2 BLAS routines (like matrix-vector multiplication). For these,
 * there exists a class JavaBlas which contains Java implementations.</p>
 *
 * <p>In LAPACK, there exist routines which require workspace to be allocated together
 * with a standard procedure for computing the size of these workspaces. jblas
 * automatically also generates wrappers for these routines with automatic
 * workspace allocation. These routines have the same name, but the workspace
 * arguments are removed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Finally, an example: The fortran routine<pre>
 * SUBROUTINE DAXPY(N,DA,DX,INCX,DY,INCY)
 *     DOUBLE PRECISION DA
 *     INTEGER INCX,INCY,N
 *     DOUBLE PRECISION DX(*),DY(*)
 * </pre>
 * becomes <pre>
 * public static native void daxpy(int n, double da, double[] dx, int dxIdx,
 *    int incx, double[] dy, int dyIdx, int incy);
 * </pre>
