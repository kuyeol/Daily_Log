# The Ruby Java PreProcessor
#
# Contrary to the "usual" cpp, commands will be expanded "in-place" in
# an idempotent fashion (meaning that you can run rjpp on the same
# file more than once.)
#
# Directives are either given as
#
# /*# ... directive ... #*/
#
# After expansion, the code will look like this:
#
# /*# original directive #*/
# //RJPP-BEGIN------------------------------------------------------------
# expanded code
# //RJPP-END--------------------------------------------------------------
#
# So you can run the rjpp twice on a file and get the same result as
# running it once. This property is called idempotency in mathematics X-D
#
# New feature:
#
# /*


# print usage
if ARGV.length == 0
  puts "Usage: rjpp file"
