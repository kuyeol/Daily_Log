# This file defines the main types for representing
# functions/subroutines and their arguments.

# Two helper functions +subroutine+ and +function+ are defined which
# construct a Routine object representing either a subroutine (with
# return type 'VOID' or a function.
#
# Note that all types are basically represented by strings.
#
# Ideally, all the information about different types of arguments
# should be contained in the classes FortranType or Routine, and
# not encoded "by hand" elsewhere.
