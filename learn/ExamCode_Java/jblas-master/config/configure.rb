Usage: ./configure [options]

options summary:
  --lapack=DIR             lapack-lite directory
  --lapack-build           build against fortran lapack instead of ATLAS
  --libpath=DIR1:DIR2:...  comma separated list of directories to contain
                           the ATLAS libraries
  --download-lapack        try to download and compile lapack if not
                           found
  --static-libs            look for static libraries only. Results in a
                           dynamically loaded jblas library which does
                           not depend on lapack or atlas libraries. 
                           (default for Windows!)
  --ptatlas                Link against multithreaded versions of ATLAS libraries
  --arch-flavor=...        Set architectural flavor (e.g. --arch-flavor=sse2)
  --libs=lib1,lib2,...     Override libraries to search in
