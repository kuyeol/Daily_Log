Couldn\'t locate sources for LAPACK and BLAS. Supply the location
of the lapack sources with the --lapack=... switch. Sources for lapack can be
found at http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-lite-3.1.1.tgz or try
running configure with the --download-lapack option.

Compling jblas should work, but unless you have the LAPACK and BLAS sources
you cannot add further stubs.
