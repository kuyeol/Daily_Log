Command Pattern

1) Intent:
- Encapsulate a request in an object. 
  I.e. object contains information needed to call a method at a later time. 
  information includes method name, the object that owns the method and parameter values.
- Give ability to parameterize different requests
- Give ability to save requests in a queue

2) Command pattern involves client, invoker and receiver
+ Client instantiates the command object and provides the information required to call the method at a later time.
+Invoker decides when the method should be called. 
+Receiver is an instance of the class that contains the method's code.
