 Lance Armstrong meets goal in painful marathon debut

 <B>N</B>EW YORK - His face twisted in pain, Lance Armstrong virtually walked
 the last couple of steps. He slowed to a halt immediately after the finish line and
 bent to the ground, his green shirt soaked with sweat.<BR>
 Armstrong barely met his lofty goal of breaking 3 hours in his first marathon,
 but it came at a price. No Alpine climb on his bicycle had ever been as tough
 as Sunday&rsquo;s New York City Marathon, he said.<BR>
 For the level of condition that I have now, that was without a doubt the hardest
 physical thing I have ever done,&rdquo; said Armstrong, who finished 856th.
 &ldquo;I never felt a point where I hit the wall, it was really a gradual
 progression of fatigue and soreness.&rdquo;
<P>Armstrong&rsquo;s time was 2 hours, 59 minutes and 36 seconds.
Afterward, he shuffled into a post-race news conference, his right shin heavily taped.
<BR>
I think I bit off more than I could chew, I thought the marathon would be easier,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;(My shins) started to hurt in the second half,
especially the right one. I could barely walk up here, because the calves are completely
knotted up.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Armstrong&rsquo;s build presented a stark contrast to the elite men&rsquo;s runners
who preceded him on the course.
The cycling champion&rsquo;s heavily muscled legs and powerful chest set him apart from
the slender Kenyans who traditionally dominate the race.
Even Armstrong compared the leaders&rsquo; legs to pencils.
</P>
<P>And while there was little joy among the leaders during the race, Armstrong smiled
and chatted amiably during the first half of the race.
He wore a shirt saying LANCE and displaying the numbers 10/2 - the date 10 years ago
on which he was diagnosed with cancer, before he began his
amazing Tour de France streak.
</P>
<P>He was paced for most of the race by former marathon champions Alberto Salazar and
Joan Benoit Samuelson and middle-distance running great Hicham El Guerrouj, and said
he got a lot of support from fans packed along the course.
</P>
<P>But his body seemed to tighten and showed signs of pain and fatigue in the final
few miles. He started to fall off the pace required to
break 3 hours before a final push allowed him to meet his personal goal.
</P>
<P>Before the race that was my goal, I wanted to break 3 hours. But if you told me
with 3 miles to go, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re going to do 3:05,&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t have
cared,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Honestly, at the end I was so tired, I couldn&rsquo;t care.
Now I&rsquo;m glad I did.&rdquo;
</P>
<P>About an hour after the men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s champions had crossed the
finish line, the Central Park crowd really started to buzz as Armstrong approached.
Fans seemed much more enthused at seeing Armstrong than watching a Brazilian man and
a Latvian woman win titles earlier on a crisp autumn afternoon.
</P>
<P>Lance added a lot,&rdquo; said race director Mary Wittenberg. &ldquo;He was a delight
throughout. Everybody is so excited about him. He beat a lot of odds and impressed
a lot of people.&rdquo;
