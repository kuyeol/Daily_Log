Google&apos;s sales pitch to newspapers
<P>
 Google long ago set the bar for ad sales online.
 Now it&apos;s out to do the same in the musty old newspaper business.
</P>
<P>
 The Internet leviathan is launching a program to sell ads
 in major newspapers across the U.S., starting with a three-month trial
 with publishers including Hearst, Gannett, the Washington Post Co. and
 the New York Times Co. It&apos;s not looking for revenue right away, but that
 will change sometime next year when the system gets a formal launch.
</P>
<P>
 Why would Google bother with an aging, long-suffering print business
 when it so clearly dominates the medium of the moment? The answer just
 might lie in the annual U.S. outlay of $48 billion on newspaper advertising,
 according to a New York Times article Monday citing Google&apos;s print guy.

 &quot;Is it a good idea? Of course, it is. It is an idea the newspaper industry
 should have taken on itself 10, no 20 ago. It&apos;s not just about the internet.
 It&apos;s about finding ways to serve small local advertisers with self-serve sales
 and new locally focused products. It&apos;s also about finding ways to bring together
 newspapers into national networks that can sell demographically targeted ads
 to new marketers.&quot;

 &quot;Truth be told, Google, isn&apos;t looking to do newspapers any favours;
 it&apos;s simply using its brand and clout with advertisers to diversify
 its advertising &apos;engine&apos; to markets where it can generate more business -
 be it newspapers, magazines, radio (dMarc) or the Web.&quot;

 &quot;Newspapers and other print pubs are going to have to scramble like hell.
 But at least part of their business--the ads readers enjoy flipping through--
 should endure, at least for a while.&quot;
