 <TITLE>New York City Marathon</TITLE>
<BODY>
<P>No mountain climb on a bicycle was ever as tough as Sunday&apos;s New York City Marathon,
Lance Armstrong said after barely meeting his lofty goal of breaking 3 hours in his first marathon.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For the level of condition that I have now, that was without a doubt the hardest physical thing
I have ever done,&quot; said the seven-time Tour de France champion, who covered 26.2 miles in
2 hours 59 minutes 36 seconds. He had never run farther than 16 miles.
&quot;It was really a gradual progression of fatigue and soreness.</P><BR>
<P>
&quot;I didn&apos;t train enough. In 20 years of endurance sports, even the worst days on the Tour,
nothing felt like that or left me the way I feel now.&quot;
<BR><BR>
His body seemed to tighten and showed signs of pain and fatigue in the final few miles.
He started to fall off the pace required to break 3 hours, but a final push allowed him to do it.
<BR><BR> &quot;At the end I was so tired, I couldn&apos;t care,&quot; he said. &quot;Now I&apos;m glad I did.&quot;<BR><BR>
So will he be back?<BR><BR> &quot;Now&apos;s not the time to ask that question,&quot; he said.
&quot;The answer now is no, I&apos;ll never be back. But I reserve the right to change my mind.
I don&apos;t know how these guys do it.&quot; </P>
