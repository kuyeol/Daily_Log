 Authorities dismiss U.S. criticism of alleged 'anomalies'
 MANAGUA: Daniel Ortega, who fought the American-backed contras in a bloody war in the 1980s,
 held a strong lead over four other Nicaraguan presidential candidates in preliminary results
 here, officials said early Monday.
 With 15 percent of polling stations reporting, Ortega had 40 percent, versus 33 percent
 for his Harvard-educated rival Eduardo Montealegre of the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance.
 Trailing behind were a Sandinista dissident Edmundo Jarqu√≠n; the governing party's
 candidate, Jose Rizo; and a former contra rebel, Eden Pastora.
 If Ortega, a former Marxist revolutionary, does not squeeze out a first- round victory
 and is forced into a runoff next month, analysts expect him to lose, because the country's
 strong anti-Ortega opposition would unite against him.
