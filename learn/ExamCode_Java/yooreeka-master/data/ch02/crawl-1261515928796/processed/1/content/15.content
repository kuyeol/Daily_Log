 MANAGUA: Daniel Ortega, who fought the American-backed contras in a bloody war in the 1980s,
 held a strong lead over four other Nicaraguan presidential candidates in preliminary results
 here, officials said early Monday.
 </P>
 <P>
 With 15 percent of polling stations reporting, Ortega had 40 percent, versus 33 percent
 for his Harvard-educated rival Eduardo Montealegre of the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance.
 </P>
 <P>
 Trailing behind were a Sandinista dissident Edmundo Jarqu&iacute;n; the governing party&apos;s
 candidate, Jose Rizo; and a former contra rebel, Eden Pastora.
 </P>
 <P>
 If Ortega, a former Marxist revolutionary, does not squeeze out a first- round victory
 and is forced into a runoff next month, analysts expect him to lose, because the country&apos;s
 strong anti-Ortega opposition would unite against him.
